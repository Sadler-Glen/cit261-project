                                This APP has been created as part of a personal project for a BYU Idaho paper for Computer
                                Information Techology, viz., CIT-261- JavaScript Mobile Software Development.

                                This course has been designed to allow us to become more professional by learning in an environment 
                                where the instructor is our mentor rather than a lecturer. Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript 
                                we learned to explore technologies in order to resolve problems that arise naturally. 
                                You also learned to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through 
                                creating this single page mobile web application. Having had such a mentored learning experience 
                                is very important when we begin your career. Exploration of tech to solve previously unsolved 
                                problems is what we will be doing for your job.
                            </p>

                                We worked in a group but we were responsible for our own learning. This was accomplished when 
                                our learning, not the team's was evaluated. To accomplish this, assessment points were created 
                                in the course. These consist of providing evidence of our fluency in the technologies in the form 
                                of sandbox code, and code we, not our team, have written. Additional evidence of professionalism 
                                is also a requirement. We came to see what these were and how our fluency and professionalism was 
                                be assessed by viewing the course rubric.
