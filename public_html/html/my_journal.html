                Week one was much to do with orientation and organizing a 
                GitHub account and to learn about agile methodologies. 
                The feeling at this stage was that we were going to work 
                as a team on a project this semester. We would later find 
                out that this was not strictly what was going to be. 
                However, having read about agile methodologies and digested 
                as best as I could, I came to realize that these real-life 
                type methodologies for working in teams would be so helpful 
                to understand for the work we would do this semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second week we met for the first time as a team. 
                At this stage I was really confused and so were my fellow 
                team mates. To make things worse for me is that I had not 
                done a lot of JavaScript, CSS, or HTML since 2015 and my 
                skills were very rusty. What was I thinking when I decided 
                to do this course? We met on the Wednesday evening of the 
                second week and to some degree, my feelings of unease 
                subsided somewhat when I discovered how cool the people 
                were that I was going to work with. Jayton was from Texas, 
                Ali from California, and Ricardo from Peru. I instantly fell 
                in love with my team. We managed to work through a teaching 
                schedule together, dividing up the 13 topics for the semester, 
                which, incidentally, had be taught by week 10. This meant that 
                we had to teach more than one topic per week. Each of us were 
                able to enjoy input and surprisingly this was not that painful. 
                I was still not entirely sure that we understood how this 
                semester was going to work, how eactly it was to be presented, 
                and to what depth. One thing we did know was that it had to be 
                presented online in the form of a web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a team we felt we needed to get to it pretty smartly so 
                Jayton boldly took on the first teaching assignment and we 
                planned to meet on the Saturday afternoon for me, Friday 
                night for everyone else, to kick off the teaching assignments. 
                Jayton did a great job and I came to realize the caliber of 
                our team was way up there. We were on our way in terms of the 
                teaching assignments, however, for me the presentation of the 
                topics was a bit hazy.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point I was presented with the new concept of GitHub 
                Pages. I had previously used GitHub versioning with java from 
                the previous semester so was somewhat familiar with GitHub. I 
                decided to continue on from the previous semester of using 
                NetBeans IDE as the basis for writing code and uploading to 
                GitHub. I did not get familiar enough with Pages until week 
                three so in week two I ended up using my personal site to 
                provide my code to Brother Baer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that this was my most difficult week – the not knowing 
                was killing me and I thought that I was simply not going to get 
                through the semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                In week three it was my teaching assignment. I had started my 
                preparation as soon as I chose the assignment in week two. Having 
                not done a lot of coding since 2015, I had to dig deep to rediscover 
                the things that I had previously learned. I am so grateful to my 
                Heavenly Father for helping me out here for he truly brought to my 
                remembrance those things which I needed to recollect. Things all changed 
                for me in Week three. On the Friday of this week we met with Brother Baer 
                and he unfolded for us the intent of the first three weeks of the course. 
                Here, he explained, we were being thrown into a real-life scenario where 
                often we are required to learn new things, practices, technologies, and 
                methodologies by being thrown into the deep end. We get to learn the depth 
                of our character and the character of those of a team when this happens. 
                How we react to these situations is all important.   
            </p>
            <p>
                From this point on I started enjoying the journey. My entries into my journal 
                from this week onwards started with comments like in week 4, “This week went 
                pretty smoothly and I’m starting to enjoy how flexible this class is.” 
                Week 5, Another really good week, was able to cover topics 6-8” 
                Week 6, “Another great week, and another great meeting…” and so it went 
                on.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked forward to our weekly team meetings. There was always an air of 
                discovery shared and we came to enjoy the time that we shared together – what 
                we had learned and what we were learning. In week six I recorded the following.        
            </p>
            <p>
                “We are moving along quite nicely and meeting our milestones that we set in week two. 
                Everyone is contributing and looking to help each other which is really great. I am 
                really, really impressed with the caliber of work that is being produced by the team. 
                Our meeting this week was taken by Jayton - He's one smart cookie and so humble with 
                it. I love who I'm working with and enjoying the way that this class is being run. 
                All I can say is that it is Fantastic.!!!
            </p>
            <p>
                By week six I had completed topics 1-8 and they had been marked and the feeling 
                was exhilarating. I was on target to submit topics 9-10 and I found that not 
                only were we on target with our team schedule, I was ahead of my personal schedule. 
                In week seven I had managed to complete topics 11-13. I was excited that very soon 
                I was going to be able to tackle the individual project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nature of the final project was not revealed until week eight where Brother 
                Baer advised that the project would be a Mobile App and that we should be thinking 
                about what that might be for each of us. He invited us to submit by email what our APP 
                would be. The Rubric for the final project, not surprisingly, was to implement the 
                topics that we had learned over the semester into the APP.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next three weeks I worked on the Weather APP. I chose to build my APP 
                around the Openweather API which gathers data from weather stations globally and 
                to also use google geolocation. The functionality that I wanted to build was:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>1)  On starting APP go to the current location using google geolocation.</li>
                <li>2)  Show the weather of the current location and a five-day forecast.</li>
                <li>3)	Input a location and display the current weather and a five-day forecast.</li>
                <li>4)	Also display a map of the location. (I did this after marking in Week 12)</li>
                <li>5)	Add animations and transitions that did not detract from the essence of the APP.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This was not without it’s difficulties but with the help of our team and a lot of trial 
                and research I managed to get through to a product where Brother Baer, in week 11, was 
                able to mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will be eternally grateful for the blessings that I received from my Heavenly Father 
                over this semester. I am so grateful for the opportunity to learn in the hallowed 
                environment of BYU Idaho, and with a team that was second to none. Each member has 
                blessed my life immeasurably and will always be remembered. Thank you, Brother Baer 
                for your mentorship over this semester. This has been a wonderful learning experience. 
                Another bonus came in the form of the new changes implemented by President Nelson and 
                the Brethren. Our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ are indeed at the helm of 
                this church. I bear testimony of this truth in the name of Jesus Christ amen.
