            <h2>Topic 02: Object Creation Functions, Inheritance, Properties, Methods, Instantiation</h2>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <blockquote>The variables in Javascript can be thought of as being named containers.
                You place data in the container and then refer to the container by naming 
                the container. Before you use a variable in a program you must <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">declare</span> 
                or <span style="color:green">initialize</span> it. This is done
                with the <span style="color:blue">var</span> keyword as follows.</blockquote>
            <h3>Declaring a variable</h3>
            <blockquote><code>var x;<br>
                    var name;</code></blockquote>
            <h3>Initializing a Variable</h3>
            <blockquote><code>var name = "Glen"<br>
                    var name;<br>
                    name = "Glen";</code></blockquote>
            <h3>Javascript Variable names</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use Javascript reserved keywords, i.e., do not use <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">break</span>
                    or <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">boolean</span> as variable names as they are not valid.</li>
                <li>Javascript variable names cannot start with a number (0-9). They must begin with a letter or and underscore
                    character. Eg., <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">59check</span> is invalid, however 
                    <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">_59check</span> is a valid variable name.</li>
                <li>Javascript variable names are also case sensitive. For example <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Name</span>
                    and <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">name</span> are two different variables.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functions & Parameters</h3>
            <blockquote>A Javascript function is a block of code designed to complete a particular task
                and is executed or runs when called or invoked.<br><br>
                <h4>For example:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When an event occurs such as when a user clicks on a button.</li>
                    <li>When it is called from some Javascript code.</li>
                    <li>Or it may call itself and therefore run automatically.</li><br>
                </ul>
                The function is defined with the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">function</span> keyword, followed
                by a <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">name</span>, followed by parenthesis 
                <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">()</span>.<br><br>
                Function names follow the same rules as variable names and can contain numbers, letters, and dollar signs.<br><br>
                Parameters may be included in the parenthesis and the code that is to be run is within the curly braces 
                <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">{}</span>,as per the example below.<br>
                
                <blockquote>
                        <code>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3,...) {<br>
                        <blockquote>code to be executed<br>
                            return value;
                        </blockquote>
                        }</code>
                </blockquote> 
                <h4>Function return</h4>
                <blockquote>When the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"> return statement</span> is reached
                    the function will stop running. If the function was called from a statement, Javascript will
                    return to the calling statement and start running the code after the calling statement. If the
                    function calculates a <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">return value</span>, this value
                    is returned back to the calling function.</blockquote>
                The beauty of functions is that once they have been defined or created, they can be reused many times
                with different parameters or arguments to produce different results.<br><br>
                The following is example code which calculates all the odd integers from 1 to n (user input). The
                function is named sumOdd() and has no parameters passed to it.<br>
                <h4>What the function does</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The user is prompted for a positive integer.</li>
                    <li>The function is invoked.</li>
                    <li>The input is validated.</li>
                    <li>The for loop starting at 1 will check for odd numbers up to the inputted integer
                        and sum these numbers with the use of the modulus feature built into Javascript.</li>
                </ol> 
                <blockquote>
                    <code>function sumOdd() {
                        <blockquote>var n = parseInt(document.getElementById("numberBox").value);<br>

        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>There are several kinds of loops utilised in Javascript which essentially end up doing the same thing. They
            are used to repeat an action a number of times depending on the requirements of the function that it is 
            implemented in. Our example Loop below repeats the action "n" times i.e., the number that is input by the
            user. <br><br>
            Notable other loops that are implemented in Javascript are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>do...while loop</li>
            <li>while loop</li>
            <li>for...in loop</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>for loop</h3>
        <p>The for loop executes until a condition evaluates to false and has the following form.</p>
        <blockquote><code>for (initial expression; condition; increment expression;){
                <blockquote>statement's </blockquote>}</code></blockquote>


        <blockquote><h4>Working Example of For Loop, and Conditional If.</h4>
            <h4>Sum all Odd Integers</h4>

        <h3>do...while Loop</h3>
        <p>The do...while loop, like the for loop, repeats until a specified
            condition is false. The difference between the two is that the 
            statement executes once in the do...while loop before the condition
            is checked. This is because the while condition is at the end of the
            code. See the syntax below.</p>

        <blockquote><code>do
                <blockquote>statement's</blockquote>
                while (condition);</code></blockquote>
        <h3>while loop</h3>  
        <p>The while loop repeats for as long as the specified condition is true.
            Unlike the For and do...while loops, the while loop tests the condition
            prior to the statements are executed. As soon as the condition evaluates 
            to false, the loop is exited and the statement following the while loop 
            takes control. See the syntax below.</p>
        <blockquote><code>while (condition)
                <blockquote>statement's</blockquote>
            </code></blockquote>

        <h3>for...in loop</h3>
        <p>The for...in loop, loops through the properties of an object and for each
            property executes the statements. See the syntax below.</p>

        <blockquote><code>for (variable in object) {
                <blockquote>statement's</blockquote>
                }</code></blockquote>

        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>As in every other programming language, the code in Javascript needs 
            to make decisions based on varying conditions, for example, something as
            simple as, depending on the weather, what footwear should I wear?<br><br>
            There are a number of conditional statements used in Javascript and 
            they are listed below.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>if</li>
            <li>if...else</li>
            <li>switch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Logical Operators: AND, OR and NOT</h3>
        <p>Logical operators can help miniise the need to use nested if...else
            statements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&&(AND)- all expressions must evaluate to be true for the whole expression to be true.</li>
            <li>||(OR) - One or more expressions must evaluate to be true for the 
                whole expression to return true.</li>
            <li>!(NOT) - This operator is used to negate an expression.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Switch</h3>
        <p>The switch statement becomes valuable when you want to take a single
            expression or value as an input and then look through a number of
            choices until one matches, then execute the corresponding code.</p>
        <h3>If..else..Example</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>This example asks the user to input the weather and based on 
                the weather the user will be advised to wear particular footwear.

        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>The Array is an object that is used to store multiple values in a single object. <br>
        Each array value can easily be accessed individually. You can create an array by declaring it, initialising it or with the use of the 
        <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"><code>new</code></span> keyword.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Ways to create / declare an Array</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <code>
                var motorcycle = [];<br>
                var motorcycle = ['Honda','Suzuki','Yamaha','Indian'];<br>
                motorcycle = new Array('Honda','Suzuki','Yamaha','Indian');<br>
            </code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Arrays are super flexible and you can do so many things with an array. 
        The following basic things can be achieved with an array. Lets use the 
        array that we declared above as an example.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>
                var motorcycle = ['Honda','Suzuki','Yamaha','Indian'];
            </code>
            <p>Things we can do with the array (Array Methods)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add to or remove from the end of an array.</li><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>motorcycle.<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">push</span>('Ducati');</code> - add to the end of the array.</li>
                        <li><code>motorcycle.<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">pop</span>('Indian');</code> - remove from the end of the array.</li><br>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>Add to or Remove from the beginning of the array.</li><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>motorcycle.<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">shift</span>('Ducati');</code> - add to the beginning of the array.</li>
                        <li><code>motorcycle.<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">unshift</span>('Honda');</code> - remove from the beginning of the array.</li><br>

        <h3>Associative Arrays</h3>
        <p>An Associative array in javascript is an object and can be declared or created dynamically. 
            It is in essence a set of key/value pairs as you see in our pseudocode example below. 
            This means that the value is stored in "association" with its key - hence the name of the 
            array. Curly braces are used as opposed to square brackets as you see below.<br>
            <code>
                <blockquote>
                    var arr = {key1 : 'value1', key2: 'value2', key3 : 'value3'}; 
                </blockquote>
            </code>
            The key may be a string, a number or an identifier. Lets look at an example that we can use 
            to show how to access and use Associative arrays. We need to remember that 
            <span style="color:blue">objects</span> are sometimes referred to as 
            <span style="color:blue">associative arrays</span>. Let's say we have a car 
            <span style="color:blue">object</span> as below.
            <code>
                <blockquote>
                    var car = {make: "Toyota", model: "Corona", year: 2017};
                </blockquote>
            </code>
            We can access the <span style="color:blue">properties</span> of the above car
            <span style="color:blue">object</span> as below.
            <code>
                <blockquote>
                    car["make"] </code>which returns "Toyota"<code><br>
                    car["model"] </code>which returns "Corona"<code><br>
                    car["year"] </code>which returns 2017
                </blockquote>
            </code>
            A simple for loop cannot be used to scan the elements in an Associative Array because
            the elements are not accessible by an index, so it is much simpler and more ideal to 
            use the for...in loop. The beauty of the for...in loop is that you do not need to 
            the position of the last element. Here is a piece of code shows the use of the for..in 
            loop
            <code>
                <blockquote>
                    var car = {make: "Toyota", model: "Corona", year: 2017};<br>
                    for(var key in car){
                    <blockquote>
                        var value = car[key];
                        document.write(key + " = " + value + 'br');</blockquote>
                    {
                    </blockquote>               
                </blockquote>
            </code>
            Let's try the above code out and see what we return.
        </p>
